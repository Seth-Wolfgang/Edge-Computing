This project is for research/learning purposes. 


-Main.java is meant to be run on one machine. It will run every part of this project together. 

-NodeMains is meant to be run on many machines. One server, at least one edge server, and many clients
 should be used.

To run correctly:
1. Run ServerMain
2. Run EdgeServerMain
3. Run ClientMain

Dependencies can be installed by running the dependencyInstaller.sh file. This will install
git, tesseract-ocr, and openjdk-17. It is meant to be any easy to use download tool for not only
getting the required software for this project, but also a lightweight download tool for the project
itself.
