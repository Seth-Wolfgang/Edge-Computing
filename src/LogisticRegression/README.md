# Logistic-Regression-JAVA
Implementation of the logistic regression algorithm in java

The link to the dataset that I used to test the algorithm:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

I used 367 instances to train the algorithm (40% of the dataset).

The reguralization parameter is 0.001 and was selected by validating the algorithm with 100 instances (20% of the dataset).

Finally the test set contains 100 instances (20% of the dataset).

The error value in the training set is 0.21 and in the test set is 0.09.
